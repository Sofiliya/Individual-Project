to 2011 where I was study at this school from the age of 7 to 9 years. Although the area of ​​this school is quite 
small, it does not hinder me from gaining knowledge. In this school, I started to be good at reading and counting.
SK Ladang is located in the middle of Kuala Terengganu City and near Batu Burok Beach & Batu Bersurat Circle. If we 
compare the area of ​​SK Ladang before and now it is very different where it is progressing with rapid buildings 
including KTCC. My transportation throughout schooling here is just walking because my house is nearby and it can 
give me  a good experience.</font></td>

KEBANGSAAN GONG KAPAS (SKGK) that located at Jalan Sultan Mohamad, Kuala Terengganu. I was moved to SK Gong Kapas by my 
parents because my mother worked there as a school clerk, so it made it easier for my mother to monitor my education at 
school and not have to worry about transport to school. I was moved to this school when i'm 10 years old and I finished 
my education as a primary school student here. This means, I take 'Ujian Peperiksaan Sekolah Rendah (UPSR). I am very 
satisfied with the results of my UPSR exam where I got 1A 1B and 3C, even I've only got 1A among the subject, I'm 
grateful because my result is all credit and no fail. At this school, I was started to hold positions such as AJK for 
sport group and treasurer for my class</font></td>

its short name which is DZALIS. This school is located in Jalan Panji Alam, Kuala Terengganu. I chose this school 
as my high school because this school is a middle school from SK Gong Kapas. However, my education as a high school 
student at DZALIS only temporarily where I changed to another high school. I only had time to school here from

I was a Top 10 student during the SPM 2019 trial and got number 1 in the class. To be honest I never reached number 1 in 
the class during my schooling. Not only that, my SPM results also did not disappoint my parents</font></td>
